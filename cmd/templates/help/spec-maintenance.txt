Manage maintenance requirements for operational tasks like dependency upgrades
and periodic checks.

Maintenance items are stored as simple requirement lists in spec/maintenance/.
Each requirement can optionally declare a frequency (daily, weekly, monthly, etc.).
The system tracks when requirements were last actioned and computes which ones
are currently due.

Use the 'maintenance_context' MCP tool to get due requirements for agent execution.
