Create a new proposal at specification/proposal/<change-slug>/.

The change-slug should be:
    - lowercase
    - words separated by hyphens
    - contains only [a-z0-9-]

Creates the following files:
    specification/proposal/<change-slug>/
        specification.md
        design.md
        implementation.md

The specification.md includes a "Depends on" field where you can list other
proposal slugs (comma-separated) that this proposal depends on. Proposals
that are dependencies cannot be activated until the dependent proposals are
completed or the dependency is removed.

Example:
    nocturnal spec proposal add add-oauth-login
