Create a new maintenance item.

Usage:
    nocturnal spec maintenance add <name-or-slug>

This creates a new file in spec/maintenance/<slug>.md with a template
for defining requirements.

Each requirement must include an [id=...] tag for tracking.
Frequency tags [freq=...] are optional (daily, weekly, biweekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly).
If frequency is omitted, the requirement is always due.

Example:
    nocturnal spec maintenance add "Go dependencies"
