Activate a proposal by setting specification/current symlink.

Creates or updates the symlink:
    specification/current -> specification/proposal/<change-slug>

Activation will fail if other proposals depend on the target proposal.
This prevents working on a proposal that serves as a dependency for others.
Complete the dependent proposals first, or remove the dependency from their
specification.md files.

Example:
    nocturnal spec proposal activate add-oauth-login
