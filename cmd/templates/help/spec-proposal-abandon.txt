Abandon a proposal without promoting its specification.

Unlike 'complete', this archives all documents but does NOT promote
the specification to section/. An .abandoned marker file is created
in the archive to indicate the proposal was not completed.

Actions performed:
    1. Archive all documents to specification/archive/<change-slug>/
    2. Create .abandoned marker file in archive
    3. Remove the proposal workspace
    4. Clear the active marker if this proposal was active

Use this when a proposal is no longer needed but you want to
preserve its documents for reference.

Example:
    nocturnal spec proposal abandon stale-feature
