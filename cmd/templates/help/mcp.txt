Start an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes agent commands as tools.

This allows AI assistants and other MCP clients to interact with nocturnal's
agent functionality programmatically.

Exposed tools:
    todowrite       Write tasks to TODO.md
    todoread        Read TODO.md from the current directory
    current         Show the currently active proposal
    docs_list       List available library and API documentation
    docs_search     Search library and API documentation by name

Example:
    nocturnal mcp
