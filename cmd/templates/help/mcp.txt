Start an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes agent commands as tools.

This allows AI assistants and other MCP clients to interact with nocturnal's
agent functionality programmatically.

Exposed tools:
    context                 Get project context (rules, spec, design) for the active proposal
    tasks                   Get current phase tasks (use task_complete to mark done)
    task_complete           Mark a task as complete by ID (e.g., "1.1")
    task_snapshot           Create a git snapshot before starting a task
    docs_list               List available library and API documentation
    docs_search             Search library and API documentation by name
    maintenance_list        List all maintenance items with due/total requirement counts
    maintenance_context     Get requirements for a maintenance item
    maintenance_actioned    Mark a maintenance requirement as actioned

Exposed prompts:
    elaborate-spec          Elaborate on a proposal with comprehensive design, steps, and dependencies
    start-implementation    Methodical implementation with investigation, planning, and testing phases
    add-third-party-docs    Generate condensed documentation for third-party libraries
    lazy                    Fast autonomous implementation - moves past blockers quickly
    start-maintenance       Execute maintenance requirements for a maintenance item
