Start an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes agent commands as tools.

This allows AI assistants and other MCP clients to interact with nocturnal's
agent functionality programmatically.

Exposed tools:
    context                 Get project context (rules, spec, design) for active proposal or maintenance item
    tasks                   Get current phase tasks for proposal or maintenance (use task_complete to mark done)
    task_complete           Mark a proposal task or maintenance requirement as complete
    docs_list               List available library and API documentation
    docs_search             Search library and API documentation by name
    maintenance_list        List all maintenance items with due/total requirement counts

Exposed prompts:
    elaborate-spec          Elaborate on a proposal with comprehensive design, steps, and dependencies
    start-implementation    Methodical implementation with investigation, planning, and testing phases
    add-third-party-docs    Generate condensed documentation for third-party libraries
    lazy                    Fast autonomous implementation - moves past blockers quickly
    start-maintenance       Execute maintenance requirements for a maintenance item
