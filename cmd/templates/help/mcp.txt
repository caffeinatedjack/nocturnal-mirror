Start an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes agent commands as tools.

This allows AI assistants and other MCP clients to interact with nocturnal's
agent functionality programmatically.

Exposed tools:
    rules           Get project rules and design context
    current         Show active proposal (specification and design only)
    tasks           Get implementation tasks for active proposal
    docs_list       List available library and API documentation
    docs_search     Search library and API documentation by name

Example:
    nocturnal mcp
