Remove a proposal from specification/proposal/<change-slug>/.

Safety checks:
    - Refuses if the proposal is currently active (unless --force is used)
    - Refuses if the proposal does not exist

Example:
    nocturnal spec proposal remove add-oauth-login
    nocturnal spec proposal remove --force add-oauth-login
