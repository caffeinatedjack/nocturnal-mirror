Mark a requirement as actioned (records current timestamp).

Usage:
    nocturnal spec maintenance actioned <slug> <id>

Records the current time as the last actioned time for the specified requirement.
This updates the due calculation for future runs.

The ID must exist in the maintenance file, otherwise this command will error.

Example:
    nocturnal spec maintenance actioned go-deps lint
