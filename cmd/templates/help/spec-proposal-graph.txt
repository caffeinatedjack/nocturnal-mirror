Show proposal dependency graph.

Visualizes dependencies between proposals, showing which proposals
depend on others and which are blocked. Completed specifications
are shown as satisfied dependencies.

Output formats:
  ascii  Terminal-friendly tree view (default)
  dot    Graphviz DOT format for rendering with 'dot' command

The graph will warn about circular dependencies if detected.

Examples:
    nocturnal spec proposal graph              # Show all proposals
    nocturnal spec proposal graph my-feature   # Show specific proposal and its dependencies
    nocturnal spec proposal graph -f dot       # Output DOT format
    nocturnal spec proposal graph -f dot | dot -Tpng -o graph.png  # Render to PNG
